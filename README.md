# DengueGo! Application

Application created using Flutter to:

* Check Dengue cases within given location.
* Display safety measure guidelines.

DengueGo! contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using this code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
